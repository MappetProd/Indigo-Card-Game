# Indigo-Card-Game
This project was being made during my education on JetBrains Academy and its name is "Indigo Card Game".

So, the rules are easy: you should take more points then your opponent.

There are 4 cards on the table (the deck has 52 cards) and every player (user and "AI") has 6 cards at the start. Cards on the table will be taken if player throws a card that has the same suit or rank as the top table card. A player get 1 point in case of getting cards with the following suits: A, 10, J, Q, K. Also at the end of the game a player gets 3 points in case of having more cards than an opponent. So, the max amount of points is 23. If both players have the same amount of cards, a player, who took a move first, gets 3 points.

Computer player (your infinite opponent) stick to some logic by throwing cards (it's not just random actions).
